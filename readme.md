hello, and welcome to VA-MP Voice Attack Mission Packs

Check out the wiki here in Github, probably the best chance of understanding what this weird project is all about ;)

VAMP – Voice Activated Mission Packs

Each pack enables a particular mission enhancement, and can be used in isolation, or combined with any other others:

VAUS – Unit Spawner
VAAS – Asset Spawner
VACF – Coord Finder
VAAS – Artillery
VAAR – Airborne Reinforcements
VAHC – High Command
VAOG – OPFOR Generator
VAOC – Objective Creator

Some packs are best used pre-mission, some are used during the mission.

Pre-Mission

VAUS / Voice Activated Unit Spawner
· Create DC or HC Groups
· 8 different group options
· 2 different camos
· Classes can be reconfigured to user preference

VAAS / Voice Activated Asset Spawner
· Cars, Helis or Ammo spawned nearby (currently only cars)
· Vics can be crewed or empty
· Classes can be reconfigured to user preference

VAOG / Voice Activated OPFOR Generator - Coming Soon
· Creates enemy activity in your area
· Dictate specific behaviour, or randomise
· Can be reconfigured to user preference

VAOC / Voice Activated Objective Creator - Coming Soon
· Dynamic (and simple) objectives based on player location and terrain
· Will recognise items of interest within 5 KM, such as Mil-Bases, Towns etc

During-Mission

VACF / Voice Activated Coordinate Finder
· Rangefinder enhancement to assist long-range fire missions (effective to up to 5km)
· Assists in forming 10-grid position based on visual obersvations only (i.e. no need to use map)
· Elevation adjustment coming soon

VAAS / Voice Activated Artillery System
· HE, Surgical, Smoke, Flares (currently only HE and Surgical)
· Enables “repeat” and “adjust fire” orders - coming soon
· Can be timed so as to enable multiple events simultaneously - coming soon
· Adjustable kill-zones for surgical strikes - coming soon

VAAR / Voice Activated Airborne Reinforcements - Coming Soon
· Essentially the Unit Spawner, but more immersive
· Selected groups are para-dropped to a location
· You confirm location and timing by voice
· Troops can be dropped in at a designated time in the future
· RF can also be called off at the last minute
· Can be reconfigured to user preference

VAPS / Voice Activated Planning System

VAHC / Voice Activated High Command
· Command up to 5 different elements using just voice
· Command 360 movement and distance
· Waypoints can be stacked (then vs how copy)
· Order attack, defend, search and stealth missions

VAMP uses on-screen indicators, to ensure that any voice translation issues are understood instantly by the user. It also uses some light-weight on-screen displays to manage information.

VAMP requires the user to have a paid-for version of Voice Attack, or any other voice activation system, that can recognise the 500+ commands involved here.

Numbers can be entered as single digits, doubles or trebles, to speed up data input. For example, to enter a 10-grid, you could say “197” “436” “33”, or “19” “74” “36” “33”, however you cannot say “1974” 3633” (at least not yet anyway).

User should be comfortable making high level changes to VA profiles, if they wish to edit the required trigger text. For example, the default VAP (Voice Attack Profile) that comes with the mod allows the user to say “Forward Observer Requesting Fire Mission” (after which, a certain key is pressed automatically). This can be easily changes to “Delta 1 Requesting Fire Mission”, for the exact same effect in-game.

Usage:
Option 1 – Basic Editor Usage
To use the script in SP, simply copy all relevant files into an empty editor mission to play. The mission should just have the mission file, and no other file in the folder to avoid conflicts.

Option 2 – Integration into existing mission
This could be a bit more tricky, and depends on what types of files are already in the mission. Most likely you’d need to modify your mission’s init and description.ext files, but really should only be copy and paste of key content into your content. Talk to me here or on discord and I can talk you through it.

Option 3 (specific) – Integration into KP Liberation
I have used VAMP in KP SP, and requires some minor changes to make work. I will document these steps in a video, but as before, reach out if you get stuck.

Option 4 – MP
This is currently untested!

It is recommended that you familiarise yourself with the playbooks included in the files. These give you a view of the conversational flows, which you will need to follow in order to get the results you want. I have tried to assist with some on-screen prompts, but looking at the docs might save you some frustration.

You activate the entire pack by pressing one key – this can be changed in the config. Once opened, the system relies on the numpad, and while these can also be remapped, it is recommended that you use the numpad. There may be CBA options down the line if this has any uptake, but for now we’re working with numpad.

Technically you do not need VA software, and could operate the menu system with key presses (that is basically what VA does, i.e. converts your wishes into key presses). Keyboard is much less immersive, but does work if you’re not able to holler down the mic while playing (i.e. those who play in ‘shared space’).
