concept is to enable the user to go into the map, and designate primary and secondary targets
Also, can set 1 or numerous waypoints for units to follow

There are two obj settings - primary and secondary

When set, these can be used as location instructions
    Move to Obj Secondary
    Attack Obj Primary 
    etc

Waypoints can be set in the map, but must be executed in display 46

I would like to have some order when units arrive at a staging zone

to do this, you need to send the lead unit away, and then into the center, then set the formation auto to line
